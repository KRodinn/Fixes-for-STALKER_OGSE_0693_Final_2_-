		<text>[Master] He wants to kill us, Vasiliy. [Vasiliy] Kill us? How could he kill us, he's pathetic. [Master] He can't kill us. We are sick of talking to him. [Vasiliy] Yes, that's enough. Get out of here while your protection still works, Stalker, and do not ever come back. [Chorus] NOW GO AWAY!</text>

	<string id="deadcity_master_intro_dialog_11">
		<text>This is monstrous. You have to be destroyed.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="deadcity_master_intro_dialog_10">
		<text>[Master] Yes, we eat these. In case you have not noticed, what we have here isn't a complete life support equipment, we need to feed ourselves somehow. [Vasiliy] Stupid Stalkers, stupid scientists, stupid military. They come to this city. OUR city. We submit ourselves to them, offer them shelter. And when they die, we eat them. [Master] Delicacies.</text>

		<text>(You feel a cautious attempt to find a weak spot in your consciousness) [Master] What a good protection. Where do I come from? Tell him, Vasiliy. [Vasiliy] We have been brought here, in that flask. We were going to be recycled. Oh, but we aren't guinea pigs that you can dispose of.. WE recycled THEM. [Master] Excellent recycling. The water here is now very nutritious. [Vasiliy] Very nutritious, Master, excellent water. They decompose, we get to eat.</text>

	<string id="deadcity_master_intro_dialog_7">

		<text>[First] He wants to know what we are, Vasiliy. [Second] What a curious stalker. Is he a scientist? I, too, was a scientist. Let's explain it, Master. [First] Well, well, explain. [Chorus] EXPLAIN. [First] This garbage in the suit that you see before you - this is Vasily. He also wanted to know what we are. He found out. We explained to him. [Vasiliy] And what you see right behind me in the ventilation shaft and then - it is the Master. The Master is required to submit. [Chorus] SUBMIT!

		<text>(The pressure on your consciousness increases sharply, but then fades) [First] We can not enter his mind, Vasiliy. [Second] He is aggressive, Master. He is well protected. [First] Maybe he's a scientist that came to study us? [Second] Maybe we can kill him? [First] No, we can not kill him, his mind is not available, the protection interferes. [Second] Then we have to talk to him, Master. [First] Yes, talking, you can talk to him and it will give us time to think of something. [Chorus] We'll talk with you, stalker.</text>

	</string>
	<string id="deadcity_quest_reward_dialog_1_1_1_1_1">
		<text>What a deal, Prokhorov. Thanks for the nice offer.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="deadcity_quest_reward_dialog_1_1_1_1">
		<text>About you, I'm keeping my promises. Our heavy armor, "SKAT", which I heard you Stalkers appreciated. That trunk too, although it's only for storage. I'll try to get you a better one, keep the cartridge box. And here's your "Friendly-Foe" transponder. It will make us all recognize you as our friend, so you don't have to worry upon meeting a patrol now. It is waterproof, shock-proof, and powered by elemental decay, so you don't even need to use it in any way, just carry it with you. Don't try to pry it open though; it has a protection and the circuit will self-destroy. And, well... Take care of yourself, Strelok. And if you ever want to exit the Zone, I'll leave details at the checkpoint for you to contact me. I'd attach you as a consultant at the research institute on the Zone, based in Kiev. No dusty work, an easy life, and your knowledge would be very valuable.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="deadcity_quest_reward_dialog_1_1_1">
		<text>Well, that's a good end, Colonel. And what about me?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="deadcity_quest_reward_dialog_1_1">
	  <text>Good. All right, I just got in touch with the authorities. Can you believe these freaks already had sent a death notice to my house? I talked with my wife, she was in shock, already desperate about not even having a body to bury and here I am, suddenly safe and sound.. I also talked with the kids, they're waiting home. Thank you, once again. I really did not expect to get out of here. A car will soon be sent to me, then I can expect a long debriefing with the MVD, I'm sure to get the five Ws and one H, but hopefully I should be home by tomorrow. Still better than staying in the Zone - or walking. Well, fuck it.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="deadcity_quest_reward_dialog_1">
		<text>Oh, yeah, just taking a nap.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="deadcity_quest_reward_dialog_0">
		<text>Are you with me, Strelok?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="deadcity_quest_final_dialog_1_1_1_1">
		<text>Alright then.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="deadcity_quest_final_dialog_1_1_1">
		<text>Don't worry, everything will go as I promised. You have my word.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="deadcity_quest_final_dialog_1_1">
		<text>Hmm. Let's hope nobody does anything stupid.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="deadcity_quest_final_dialog_1">
		<text>Yeah, this has been a long road. Have some sleep while I go talk to the checkpoint chief, I have to report to the command. I should be back in half an hour, don't browbeat the Spetsnazs, okay? They're a bit nervous, you see. You're quite the hardened veteran.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="deadcity_quest_final_dialog_0">
		<text>Yes, it seems we've made it, Colonel. I'll need to rest for a bit, I'm exhausted.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="deadcity_quest_final_dialog_10">
		<text>Here we are, Strelok.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="deadcity_quest_escape_dialog_1_1">
		<text>Gather your things, then. Let's go.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="deadcity_quest_escape_dialog_1">
		<text>I already knew, we got jolted here too - even the walls shook, and immediately after my head got better, the voices stopped. It's like having a roof removed, or as though everyone in my head died off. Thanks a lot, Strelok. I owe you. There's only one thing - I still need to get away from here. Could you take me to the checkpoint at the Cordon? Don't worry, with me they wont touch you, and I have a transponder up and running. Then I'll talk with the higher-ups about you. I think they wont mind register you as a military Stalker. I'll have you some of our deep-Zone raid equipment, and one of our transponder - it will make us all recognize you as a friend of the army. Plus I'll set up an easy way out of the Zone for you, granted that you ever want to leave it, that is. That certaily isn't as much as what you have done for me, but it is all I can promise.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="deadcity_quest_escape_dialog_0">
		<text>It seems Master is dead. I blew the charge. The blast even made the ground shake.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="deadcity_quest_bomb_ready_dialog_1_1">
		<text>Got it. Alright, give me that can. And if anything.. Well... Don't think badly of me.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="deadcity_quest_bomb_ready_dialog_1">
		<text>Yes, everything is good. I tested some separately, just to make sure it worked - it burned through a concrete slab. The bomb is gathered in this old milk can, which is also made of aluminium, it'll add some heat. The can is hermetically sealed, and here you can see the switch, in the hole on the lid. All you have to do is to drag the can as close as possible to the things and flip the switch. It'll ignite the icendiary composition inside, and as it flares up you wont have a lot of time to escape, so don't linger! The detonation delay is only two and a half minutes, I couldn't make any longer flame retardant, so activate it and run like hell, got it? The blow will expand, reacting with water, so it might even fill the whole tunnel.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="deadcity_quest_bomb_ready_dialog_0">
		<text>Are you done with the bomb?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="deadcity_quest_bomb_assembly_dialog_1_1">
		<text>Alright, I'll rest for a bit. That stuff was kinda heavy.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="deadcity_quest_bomb_assembly_dialog_1">
		<text>Excellent. The guys already have collected some rusty iron. It will take four hours, now, so you can get some slack. All we need to do now is to grind it down to dust, and mix it in the right proportions. By the way, you can ask Bosun, he can be of any help necessary.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="deadcity_quest_bomb_assembly_dialog_0">
		<text>Here, I found all the components you needed.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="deadcity_quest_make_bomb_dialog_12">
		<text>Got it, I'll go look for your Chinook. Let's make some monster broth.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="deadcity_quest_make_bomb_dialog_11">
		<text>Aluminium, Magnesium for the ignition, and rust. A lot of rust. There are bulks of rusty iron here, I'll make guys gather it, but for the aluminium and magnesium I'll have to send you, Strelok. Go to the crash site of our Chinook. Take it from the rim of the landing gear, and a large piece of cladding. We'll then have to grind it down, mix it up with the rust, and if everything turns out ok, we will have our Thermite bomb.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="deadcity_quest_make_bomb_dialog_10">
		<text>What does it take?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="deadcity_quest_make_bomb_dialog_9">
		<text>We'll simply use a Thermite bomb. The thermite burns at extremely high temperatures; with a large amount, it will be enough to boil a pool of water. And if we're lucky, and the combustion temperature is sufficient, then the water will begin to decompose in dihydrogen and oxygen, which will in turn burn and explode, adding to the destruction. Make that thing detonate and no living thing will survive.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="deadcity_quest_make_bomb_dialog_8">
		<text>That's still a lot, how do we do that?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="deadcity_quest_make_bomb_dialog_7">
		<text>We don't need to boil all the water, just what's in the room with it.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="deadcity_quest_make_bomb_dialog_6">
		<text>How would you make such a huge volume of water boil?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="deadcity_quest_make_bomb_dialog_5">
		<text>Then here's the plan; we boil the water in there, and we cook that fucker alive.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="deadcity_quest_make_bomb_dialog_4">
		<text>I think yes. This is definitely a living thing, high temperatures should hurt him.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="deadcity_quest_make_bomb_dialog_3">
		<text>Flooded, uh? Hmmmm, then I have another idea that might work... Do you think cooking that thing would kill it?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="deadcity_quest_make_bomb_dialog_2">
		<text>There is something, large, and alive. Similar to the brain in Yantar that I disabled, but this one is out of its flask, and way larger. And I can't use my weapons there; the whole thing is flooded with water.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="deadcity_quest_make_bomb_dialog_1">
		<text>Well done, Strelok! And tell me, what did you find there?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="deadcity_quest_make_bomb_dialog_0">
		<text>I made it into the lair.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="deadcity_quest_helmet_ready_dialog_1_1">
		<text>Understood, I do a quick reconnaissance and come back immediately.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="deadcity_quest_helmet_ready_dialog_1">
		<text>Seems pretty good. Hold on [Giving you the psy-helmet] See? Just, very careful.. There. Good! Now, at first, get in there just to reconnoiter. Don't try anything yet. Find out what is in there, what Master looks like, and quickly return. We will think of what to do next.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="deadcity_quest_helmet_ready_dialog_0">
		<text>So, how did it turn out, with the helmet?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="deadcity_quest_helmet_dialog_14">
		<text>Well, here you go, then. [Giving the psy-helmet to Prokhorov]</text>
	</string>
	<string id="deadcity_quest_helmet_dialog_13">
		<text>Nothing special, I've got everything I need here, the radio will provide additional parts. Leave it to me, I'll be done in half an hour. I'll keep it until I'm done with it though. So don't- The lair is flooded, you said? You'll have to put on one of these scientific suit or a military stalker armor. They have a closed life-support system, and they rely only on the air inside the suit. Keeps you breathing for a long time, simply by filtering and absorbing the carbon dioxide from it.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="deadcity_quest_helmet_dialog_12">
		<text>Great! What do you need?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="deadcity_quest_helmet_dialog_11">
		<text>Let's say this pattern is set to one, a constant ratio of frequency and amplitude. We could try to alter it a bit, so that this ratio adjusts automatically respectively the strength and parameters of the helmet emission when needed.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="deadcity_quest_helmet_dialog_10">
		<text>So what do we do?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="deadcity_quest_helmet_dialog_9">
		<text>Rather, there seems to be some parameter to the radiation, frequency by amplitude. In the city itself the radiation amplitude is weaker, thus in bounds to be blocked by the helmet. In the lair though, it is not enough.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="deadcity_quest_helmet_dialog_8">
		<text>Then why doesn't it work in the lair?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="deadcity_quest_helmet_dialog_7">
		<text>... It seems that Sakharov decided to use wave interference - he set the helmet to emit a signal similar to the radiation acting upon the helmet, but opposed to it. As a result, the waves cancel each other and do not reach the brain. A very effective scheme.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="deadcity_quest_helmet_dialog_6">
		<text>I knew it.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="deadcity_quest_helmet_dialog_5">
		<text>So, let's see. Hm. The radiating antenna... Yeah, but this - obviously recieving. Very good, professor. Well! This helmet is a radiation counter-transmitter.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="deadcity_quest_helmet_dialog_4">
		<text>Yes, Sakharov. Here. [Showing the psy-helmet to Prokhorov]</text>
	</string>
	<string id="deadcity_quest_helmet_dialog_3">
		<text>Let me think... So, did Sakharov make this helmet, by any chance? Let me give it a look. I worked as an engineer before joining the army, an electronician.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="deadcity_quest_helmet_dialog_2">
		<text>Yeah, with difficulty, but I think I found his lair. That's just I can't get in, there is an emission that even my helmet can't cope with. In addition, it is thoroughly flooded with water.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="deadcity_quest_helmet_dialog_1">
		<text>What is it? Did you find the intel?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="deadcity_quest_helmet_dialog_0">
		<text>Colonel, about the Master..</text>
	</string>
	<string id="deadcity_quest_start_dialog_14">
		<text>Got it. See you later.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="deadcity_quest_start_dialog_13">
		<text>Well, good luck then. Ask Bosun if you need equipment. The moment you find something significant bring it to me immediately, got it?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="deadcity_quest_start_dialog_12">
		<text>Alright, I'll go search for it.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="deadcity_quest_start_dialog_11">
		<text>Yeah, that's the problem, they fled. One stole the reels and flew into the city. Then the second, too, who covered him. And all the data is in their PDA. Where they are now - I have no idea. But you have a protective device, you can find them and retrieve the data from their PDA. Search the city, they couldn't go far. Just remember: no matter what happens, you must be here in the shelter at nine every evening. Master awakens at nine, and by this time we'll have the doors locked tight, and we wont open until six in the morning. Remember, half an hour before time is up we'll activate the siren. The moment you hear it, drop everything and run to us, sprinting, okay?\n</text>
	</string>
	<string id="deadcity_quest_start_dialog_10">
		<text>And how? Where did these two guys go?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="deadcity_quest_start_dialog_9">
		<text>You understand that this thing has to be destroyed. While it rules the city, I can't rest, not can we break out, it would cook our brains. We'll just all die of starvation as a result, that's all. But I've got another idea. I think those scientists didn't just go to the river. I'm a former artilleryman, I understand how triangulation works. They probably found the source of the radiation. And those two who allegedly went to collect water samples were most likely sent to this river to scout. And they apparently found something, since all that shit happened. We need to find their data.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="deadcity_quest_start_dialog_8">
		<text>Well, that's already a more complete story. So what do you suggest to end all this?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="deadcity_quest_start_dialog_7">
		<text>It started with the night. What a nightmare. Creepy hallucinations, minds breaking, the voices in my head. We, the military, had it better. We had the same equipment as military stalkers. The scientists, they just had space suits. They started tossing around, having words. They grabbed some guns, and a shootout started. It was complete shit. And then we became flooded with beasts and zombies, and it was a mess. We somehow barricaded ourselves on the second floor and held it. The hallucinations worsened. We had to shoot dead a couple soldiers. At two in the night, it became clear we'd all be crazy or dead by morning if we didn't decide on something quick. We dismantled the barricade, fought our way to the vehicles, jumped into the armors and drove the hell out of this town. The first one burst into flame, and we ended up in a swamp. The third one went into a vortex and broke, with half the people inside it. We still somehow had communication so I called for an emergency evacuation. It took half an hour to wake up the higher-ups on their night flight but in the end they sent us a Chinook. It got to us, landed, we quickly loaded the wounded, boarded, and - well, let's take off. As it sarted flying over the city, I went to the cockpit and the pilot looked at me weirdly and said: Master told you not to run away. You misbehaved. And he starts flying directly towards the ground. I rolled over, grabbed some handrail and then, a blow... and I can't remember anything else. Only scraps. Some subway tunnel, with wagons. A bridge. And the voice of Master, giving me orders. I somehow arrived here alone.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="deadcity_quest_start_dialog_6">
		<text>And what happened next?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="deadcity_quest_start_dialog_5">
		<text>No, not me. It talks to me. I hear it in my head, at night. I tried drowning it in vodka, but the more I drink the worse it is. The guys here twist a finger at their temple, they think I'm crazy, but I'm not, I kwow he exists. And you will understank, just listen carefully. So after we came here and began the study, everything went strangely. Well, maybe not that much, we're in the Zone after all, but still there were some wery strange coincidences. Some that were too weird, even for the Zone. After something like a week, the scientists said they think they know what's going on, and they start comparing everything to Yantar. They talked with Sakharov about their observations, some Kaymanov emmiter, and non-standards radiation parameters. Triangulation of some sort needed to be done, and they climbed buildings with the devices, measuring radiations at different points, apparently. And the day before it started, a couple of scientists gathered by the river to take water samples. A sampling like any other. Since they were going out, I gave them an escort. And they disappear for a long time, but it starts really botering us in the evening. The remaining scientists are nervous, whispering stuff. And just when I was about to send a team to look for them - they come back. But they were scary. Pale. Without samples, and without escort. All mumbling some nonsens about some Master, and that he was supposedly awake and not very happy. The head of the expedition, professor Seversky, locked himself up with them and questioned them for a long time. He came out very nervous and not saying anything to anyone, I called him on the private channel. And the scientists that went to the river got a sedative and were put to bed.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="deadcity_quest_start_dialog_4">
		<text>Did you talk to it?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="deadcity_quest_start_dialog_3">
		<text>I'll tell you, I'll tell you... I've already told everyone but they won't believe me, dammit. Basically, there is something under this town. Something alive. And it does something to the city, like a controller, only much stronger. Master. It calls itself Master.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="deadcity_quest_start_dialog_2">
		<text>Wait, not so fast. Tell me what happened to you. From the very beggining.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="deadcity_quest_start_dialog_1">
		<text>Yeah, I really need help, Stalker. This thing is still picking in my brain, I'm not myself anymore. Fucking Master...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="deadcity_quest_start_dialog_0">
		<text>Salutations, Colonel. Bosun says you need help?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="deadcity_barman_quest_dialog_22">
		<text>Well, I'll try.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="deadcity_barman_quest_dialog_21">
		<text>Then, well.. A couple days passed, then Prokhorov came and told us what happened. At first, everything seemed fine. It was, well... all as it should be. The protective gear helped, they had these special helmet, with the slip rings. They were recording measurments, collecting samples, poking in anomalies with their stuff. And that night, insanity started. Mass. People began to go mad. One tearing his throat with his own nails, one smashing his head against the wall, one who'd just - the barrel in his mouth and.. And then the beasts flooded. The people inside, mostly fighters, they barricaded themselves. Most scientists had gone mad and fled in every direction in complete confusion. And here they were - in the night, surrounded by creatures, with the guys inside going off one after another. In the morning, those who were still able to think tried to escape. The surviving scientists were loaded onto the guards, and driven blindly out of the city. The first APC exploded, the second drowned in the lake, and the third got into a powerful vortex and broke into pieces. Prokhorov was among the survivors from the second and the third. He called for an evacuation on the radio, and they sent a cargo helicopter. They even managed to land and take off, but then the emissions caught up on the pilots, and they crashed. Well at least they didn't manage to fly that high, and they didn't fall into an anomalous field. But what happened next, Prokhorov has not yet been able to tell. He doesn't remember anything from the fall. And as for how he reached us - he doesn't know, and he had to go through the city... Well, since, we're keeping him here. He can't be evacuated, and can't withdraw because you'd have to go through the city and he no longer has a protective suit. And yeah, it also seems he's been a bit mind damaged after all this. He always talks about some master of the city, saying that you need to kill it, otherwise we here are all doomed, and he smokes continuously. Speak to him, you might think of a way to get him out of here, and how to bring us along. At the same time maybe he could help us too.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="deadcity_barman_quest_dialog_20">
		<text>And what happened next?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="deadcity_barman_quest_dialog_19">
		<text>We opened, pulled him in and closed the door as quickly as we could. That shit was crazy. The Colonel's face was white as a sheet, spattered in blood, drooling, unable to speak calmly, just screaming and mumbling something in panic. His armor was completely trashed, his helmet badly dented, it was a wonder how he managed to reach us. Forced him to drink half a bottle of vodka, cut off what was left of his protection, and put him to bed. We spent the whole night on tenterhooks, then in the morning we went to investigate. The Colonel didn't come - he slept for three days. We went to the building where they had been - in the old gym, at the central square, and there my friend, Hell. A terrible mess, furniture piled at the door as if they tried to lock themselves in, blood all around the building, the equipment just good to be put in the trash. But at the same time - not a living soul, and what's even worse - no corpses. It became clear that shit had gone down, there, and since that night, everything in the city has been sharply worse. The central part is now akin to Yantar, whoever's got a brain simply wouldn't go there. Controllers appeared where they weren't before, and with them a lot of zombies. They're roaming the city in bulks, now. We whom had come for the artifats now can't get away.. Yeah, that's our global situation.</text>

		<text>Well, town-32 has always been quite an inhospitable place, but lately, everything has gone to shit. A few weeks after your group has gone, a major scientific expedition came here, with all the high-tech stuff they could carry and a full military escort. They started taking all their measurments, trying some brand new research, the usual thing. We helped them on little things, extorted them for a few rare artifacts, but mostly they didn't bother with us. They had protective suits that, as I understood, protected them from the local radition. And it seemed to work pretty well, actually. And then a couple weeks ago, when the scientists had spent about a week here, we were sitting the night out, playing backgammon. It was about four in the night. And suddenly there's been this wild knocking on the door, and someone shouting "Help!", and so on. Well it was night so we usually make them wait in front of the door, which we'd keep locked even more tightly. It would be dumb to open it, after all, with the whole town crawling up at night... But then I suddenly recalled the voice. It's Colonel Prokhorov yelling outside! The security chief of the expedition! Yelling that hard, I almost couldn't make out his voice. And I'm thinking what is he doing here, away from all their protective equipment and APC?</text>

		<text>What's going on in this city? I mean, sure, we're in the Zone, but it still seems a bit overkill to me, even from her.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="deadcity_barman_quest_dialog_15">
		<text>Well, let's start with the beggining. This town, it's an eerie place. You can't spend the night in it, you'd go mad. It has something to do with psyche; you have terrible hallucinations, stuff distorts around you.. Basically you just go nuts. But although it's so wild and eerie, it also holds a lot of valuable artifacts. Finding them is hard, though, even while the sun shines. And somehow we, having gone for a raid in this place of evil, stumbled by accident (in fact running away from the sunset) on this old bomb shelter with strong hermetic doors. At the time, we didn't really have the time to get through the city, so we dared locking ourselves in for the night, and not only did we survive, but none of us had gone mad, though the fear left its mark on some. We remembered this location, shared it among our friends, and soon it began to be used as a permanent cache in which was left useful supplies and where we can wait out the night. Soon all Stalkers know this area as an asylum, and often several groups meet here at sunset. Now, simply waiting from sunset to dawn - that's boring. As a result, steel playing cards, dices, and the like were carried here, and you'd leave yourself food and a drink for the next evening. We brought a pool table from the building cornered with the city commitee, even a diesel generator, a couple tables equipped with cozy seats. And it has become a duty to keep it clean and make sure no monster ever came in... We tied a GO's siren on top of one of the old building, powered by a generator. We play the siren at dusk to inform those who stayed in the city that it's time to cut bait and run for a shelter. As the holy place is never empty, finally arrived a long-staying Stalker, someone no longer expected on the Mainland, who remained behind the bar to monitor things, to keep this outpost of civilization in order. And that guy's me. That's the story, so now I'm here on duty.</text>

	<string id="deadcity_barman_quest_dialog_14">
		<text>But how did this whole bar appear?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="deadcity_barman_quest_dialog_13">
		<text>We were together at the time we made our way into the Zone. On the northern part, from Belarus. We've found a lot of artefact, many of them unique. Then, after the second emission made new parts of the Zone become accessible, you came that way. I followed you here and founded the bar. You went further to investigate, and I settled, setting up a base. Eventually, commerce established a little.</text>

		<text>Tell me from whence you know my team.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="deadcity_barman_quest_dialog_11">
		<text>So that was true... I'm sorry, they were good guys. So that's our situation, uh? Well, in that case, I'll try to at least give you a hand, as an old friend. Ask whatever you're interested in, and I'll tell you what I know, as well as the reason I called you here.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="deadcity_barman_quest_dialog_10">
		<text>They died. Fang near the warehouses, shot down by a mercenary, and Ghost in the laboratory under Yantar.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="deadcity_barman_quest_dialog_9">
		<text>Hey, then what about your team, Ghost and Fang, do you know what they're up to?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="deadcity_barman_quest_dialog_8">
		<text>Well, I can remember stuff from since I woke up. The rest slowly restores. It's still not completely back but sometimes I dream of my past, and I remember fragments when in a familiar place.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="deadcity_barman_quest_dialog_7">
		<text>Bloody hell. Don't you remember anything at all?</text>

	<string id="deadcity_barman_quest_dialog_6">

		<text>Come on.. You? Amnesia? You're kidding, right?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="deadcity_barman_quest_dialog_4">
		<text>Basically, it seems to have something to do with me going to the center of the Zone. I lost my memory.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="deadcity_barman_quest_dialog_3">
		<text>Protective helmets - that's great. We really need to restore our connection with the rest of the Zone, or we'll run out of supp- Wait what do you mean "almost died"?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="deadcity_barman_quest_dialog_2">
		<text>Um, well, in a sense, I really almost died. And as for the City, I wear a special protective helmet Sakharov has made for me.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="deadcity_barman_quest_dialog_1">
		<text>Yes, hello, Strelok! I'm glad to see you are going well. Where have you lost that much time? Rumors already had it that you were off the radar, and there was no sign of you being still alive. There's now a bigger fry than Yantar, we've been stuck here for a week, unable to leave. We're already low on water and food, and unless something is done soon, we'll go out of business.</text>

	<string id="cit_doctor_escape_dialog_111">

	</string>
	<string id="cit_doctor_escape_dialog_121">
		<text>When they were leading me around I noticed a sewer grate under the stairs on the first floor... If you managed to open the cell it would be possible to get out of here using that sewer... It's best to go West and then you can use the tunnel to get to Freedom.</text>

		<text>Who captured us?</text>

	<string id="cit_doctor_escape_dialog_141">
		<text>We're being held by the Mercs. Nobody really knows who they are but there are rumors that they work together with foreign intelligence services.

		<text>Go on.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="cit_doctor_escape_dialog_14111">
		<text>If you manage to get a map of the Dead City, a successful assault will be possible. The Mercs or the bandits probably have one. You could try to get it.</text>

		<text>What do you know about this place?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="cit_doctor_escape_dialog_151">
		<text>The city is split into two sections. We're on the Merc side. To the South beyond the square is where the bandits are. They're holed up in the school building Southwest of the city. In between the bases, there is a run down five-floor building and a few relatively intact ones. If the shit hits the fan, you can sit it out there. There are also some garages and a couple of small houses around that area. There are a couple of five-floor buildings and a dozen garages on the bandits' side too. The former city council building is on the other side of the square.</text>

	</string>
	<string id="cit_doctor_main_dialog_4">
		<text>Wait, I need to calm down. That's some shitty news man. I think it's all linked with your last trip into the Zone. When we saw each other the last time, you left me the key from the stash at Pripyat and the map of how to find it. I've managed to keep it - hid it from the Mercs. Here, take it, hide it well. Perhaps you'll find something there. You were saying that there's some trick with the Monolith. But I don't understand what it was about, and you didn't either.</text>
