		<text>The stash contained a short report on how Fang and I infiltrated the underground galleries under the station sarcophagus and found a suspicious-looking door. Fang said that he'd put together a decoder for the electronic lock for our next visit. After that we had to run for our lives. There were hordes of Monolith patrols there. Well. I also found the decoder in the stash and directions for finding the door. However, it seems that approaching the Monolith is extremely dangerous - last time we avoided going under the sarcophagus above the destroyed reactor and it seems that's where the Monolith is.</text>

		<text>There are no doubts. I remembered it all. Last year, in august, I, Ghost and Fang discovered that Brain Scorcher decreases its power strongly from time to time. May be it was due to unit cooling cycles. We broke through the whole Zone in one of that moments. I still sees enormous swarm of frigtened rats from CNPP in my dreams. When we found a suspicious door in CNPP and decided to go back and let Fang to make decoder for it, a Monolith patrol attacked us. I lost Ghost and Fang in battle and retreated to reactor hall of fourth unit. There was sinister Monolith - "Wish Granter". I was wounded seriously, losing all my strength, but I can never forget a Monolith call. Finally I passed out and didn't make it to Monolith - that wsaved my life. Fang and Ghost found me and managed to bring me out of station. I was unconscious and didn't remember this part clearly. Just remember argues between my friends about me. Fang told that I can't make it, but Ghost pulled me out. Finally they broke througn and brought me to Doctor. After I woke up, I headed to North, but didn't reach stash - surge happened. It brought me back to Doctor, being wounded again. Next time I finally reach the stash, but there were really bad news. Fang and Ghost decided to go back to CNPP without me and got into merc ambush. Fang died. I didn't wait Ghost in stash (he was already dead in Yantar lab), just went back to CNPP where was another trap but nobody who can pull me out there. Monolith washed my brain and I was sent back to Zone in death truck with clean mind, tattoo on my hand and task to kill myself.</text>
