<text>Something incomprehensible has happened to me lately. Someone tried to run over me. I'm not in a hurry to start a fight. Can you help me?</text>  
</string>

<string id="trader_relation_bandit_2">
<text>Yes, some of the guys are not happy with you. Some of the lads have hinted about getting rid of you. But I can calm the them down. Fork out 10,000 roubles and all will be settled.</text>  
</string>

<string id="trader_relation_bandit_3">
<text>Funny you should mention that. Some of the guys want to tar and feather you. All this can be sorted out, but you'll have to pay 30,000 roubles.</text>  
</string>

<string id="trader_relation_bandit_4">
<text>Many stalkers in the Zone have been talking about you! The lads are extremely dissatisfied with you. To repair this serious damage to your reputation is expensive.Pay 50,000 roubles.</text>  
</string>

<string id="trader_relation_bandit_5">
<text>Okay. Take the money.</text>  
</string>

<string id="trader_relation_bandit_6">
<text>That's a lot to pay for respect.</text>  
</string>

<string id="trader_relation_bandit_7">
<text>Agreed. Well the loot triumphs over evil. Take the money.</text>  
</string>

<string id="kkill_fraer_done_0">
<text>I've killed the Stranger.</text>  
</string>

<string id="kill_fraer_0">
<text>What jobs do you have?</text>  
</string>

<string id="kill_fraer_1">
<text>I have something, a new trader has turned up. It is bothering me a lot. He is throwing his weight around. He has set up a dishonest market and is trying to undermine my business by humiliating me in front of the lads, he has no concept of fair trade. Like a hungry rat - he won't leave empty handed. But, he is not the thief, it's Borov who is behind it all! For the work, you'll get a very good bandit cloak.</text>  
</string>

<string id="kill_fraer_2">
<text>Does this guy have a name?</text>  
</string>

<string id="kill_fraer_3">
<text>He's smart. They just call him Stranger. It's necessary to make him go away quietly, without messing up.</text>  
</string>

<string id="kill_fraer_4">
<text>I won't cock up the job and shame you.</text>  
</string>

<string id="kill_fraer_5">
<text>Excuse me. But I won't cringe if he dies.</text>  
</string>

<string id="borov_meet_again_0">
<text>Well hello there.</text>  
</string>

<string id="borov_meet_again_1">
<text>What do you want?</text>  
</string>

<string id="borov_meet_again_2">
<text>I'm tired of being a Loner. I want to join your clan.</text>  
</string>

<string id="borov_meet_again_3">
<text>Good. Pay 10,000 roubles into a common fund, and you can join us.</text>  
</string>

<string id="borov_meet_again_4">
<text>Oh, really! Things are looking bright.</text>  
</string>

<string id="borov_meet_again_5">
<text>I don't have the money now. I'll come back later.</text>
</string>

<string id="borov_meet_again_6">
<text>No worries. Take the money.</text>  
</string>

<string id="chto_namutil_0">
<text>Have you been trying to rob the Duty guys?</text>  
</string>

<string id="chto_namutil_1">
<text>Brother, help me. Finish off this goat Bullet for me - before all our boys are taken by this dog,  answer me dude!  The brotherhood will be very grateful to you. If you kill this goat, I'll tell you where the hill with Duty's cache is located, and Skull's cache too. Do him in, and I cross my heart - I will wait for you here!</text>  
</string>

<string id="chto_namutil_2">
<text>For that reward, of course I will help. It's good that I found you then!</text>  
</string>

<string id="chto_namutil_3">
<text>Fuck you...</text>  
</string>

<string id="chto_namutil_4">
<text>Well simpleton, blah, don't get caught with our pants down.</text>  
</string>

<string id="chto_namutil_5">
<text>We better not waste time because there are blind dogs nearby. My days to the next world could be numbered.</text>  
</string>

<!--The prisoner thug near the Duty entry-->
<string id="cherep_treasure_0">
<text>I killed your enemy. Now, what were you saying about Skull's hiding place?</text>
</string>

<string id="cherep_treasure_1">
<text>I'll be a snake. There is a secret place where Bullet, after killing other stalkers, loved to temporarily hide his loot. I heard a rumour recently that he had hidden a nice SVD there. Just telling you. How old it is, I don't know. And maybe you could find something else there.</text>  
</string>

<string id="cherep_treasure_2">
<text>Well, you better be telling the truth.</text>  
</string>

<!--Dialogues with bodyguards Hog-->
<string id="prebandit_0">
<text>Hey, slow down, are you in a hurry?</text>  
</string>

<string id="prebandit_1">
<text>Yes I am, I'm going to see Borov.</text>  
</string>

<string id="prebandit_2">
<text>Why? What do you want from him?</text>  
</string>

<string id="prebandit_3">
<text>He wants to talk to me.</text>  
</string>

<!--Entry into Bandits through Hog-->
<string id="borov_ask_document_0">
<text>What is it you wanted to ask?</text>  
</string>

<string id="borov_ask_document_1">
<text>Well? Have you brought the document?</text>  
</string>

<string id="borov_ask_document_2">
<text>Not yet.</text>  
</string>

<string id="borov_ask_document_3">
<text>Too bad. I won't wait long. Do you understand?</text>  
</string>

<string id="borov_ask_document_4">
<text>Yes, I think so.</text>  
</string>

<string id="borov_ask_document_5">
<text>I brought it, here you go.</text>  
</string>

<string id="borov_ask_document_6">
<text>Not bad Marked One, well, I keep the word. You got the job done without mistakes - here's the key to the lab. Listen Marked One, make sure you don't piss yourself when you go down into the lab. Would you like to join us?</text>  
</string>

<string id="borov_ask_document_7">
<text>Well. Why not?</text>  
</string>

<string id="borov_ask_document_20">
<text>Well then, you can consider yourself one of us now. Welcome to a life of thieves.</text>  
</string>

<string id="borov_ask_document_21">
<text>Well. You have helped us once, so we won't touch you now. But in the future we better not meet.</text>  
</string>

<string id="borov_ask_document_22">
<text>I've already been told that you helped Bullet die sooner, he-he. You're the man.</text>  
</string>

<string id="borov_ask_document_8">
<text>No. But thank you for the invitation, but I prefer being a Loner.</text>  
</string>

<string id="borov_ask_document_9">
<text>Well, we're even. You're safe for now, but in the future we better not cross paths. Heh heh heh.</text>  
</string>

<string id="borov_ask_document_10">
<text>See you later.</text>  
</string>

<string id="borov_ask_document_11">
<text>Not bad Marked One, well, I keep my word. You got the job done without mistakes - here's the key to the lab.</text>  
</string>

<string id="borov_enter_bandit_0">
<text>Good health.</text>  
</string>

<string id="borov_enter_bandit_1">
<text>So, it's Marked One himself! I've heard about you. There are rumours about you being pulled out of the death truck alive. By the way, you have a cool nickname "Marked One". And for some reason I was called Borov.</text>  
</string>

<string id="borov_enter_bandit_2">
<text>I was sent by the informant.</text>  
</string>

<string id="borov_enter_bandit_3">
<text>Informant, you say? Hmm ... Well, what do you want?</text>  
</string>

<string id="borov_enter_bandit_4">
<text>Just one thing ...</text>  
</string>

<string id="borov_enter_bandit_5">
<text>What's the matter? Speak up.</text>  
</string>

<string id="borov_enter_bandit_6">
<text>I'm looking for the key to the door to the X18 lab...</text>  
</string>

<string id="borov_enter_bandit_7">
<text>And why I should give it to you? Because you have beautiful eyes?</text>  
</string>

<string id="borov_enter_bandit_8">
<text>I can pay money for it.</text>  
</string>

<string id="borov_enter_bandit_9">
<text>Do you have a lot of money to pay? Do you ... Well ... Hmm. I know who sent you. Barkeep, we remain neutral. But we need someone who does not belonging to our group that can do one little task for us.</text>  
</string>

<string id="borov_enter_bandit_10">
<text>What kind of task? You need someone killed, I suppose?</text>  
</string>

<string id="borov_enter_bandit_11">
<text>Why would we want someone killed? We need to steal some documents from Barkeep, but it needs to be done in a way so he doesn't suspect us. These documents are kept in his room, guarded by his men. Get the job done - quietly, and I'll give you - the second key for the laboratory.</text>  
</string>

<string id="borov_enter_bandit_12">
<text>Okay.</text>  
</string>

<string id="borov_enter_bandit_13">
<text>I'm not ready yet.</text>  
</string>

<string id="borov_enter_bandit_14">
<text>I came here on a tip from your man.</text>  
</string>

<string id="borov_enter_bandit_15">
<text>Yes, I know. You rescued him. That's why we haven't touched you. I am listening.</text>  
</string>

<string id="borov_enter_bandit_16">
<text>Do you have a lot of money to pay? Do you ... Well ... Hmm. I know who bestowed the honour on you to descend into this hell, he he. Barkeep, we remain neutral. But I need a desperate man, able to execute a non-trivial matter for me.</text>  
</string>

<string id="borov_enter_bandit_17">
<text>Yes, I know. You rescued him. And, importantly, you, at his request, had a hand in the demise of Bullet. So you can join us. Don't be a stranger. What do you say to my proposal?</text>  
</string>

<!--Dead stalker-->
<string id="dead_stalker_start_dialog_1_phrase_0">
<text>What are you staring at?</text>  
</string>

<string id="dead_stalker_start_dialog_1_phrase_1">
<text>Mother of God, who or what are you?</text>  
</string>

<string id="dead_stalker_start_dialog_1_phrase_2">
<text>I was a human once ... the scientists tried to make a controller out of me, but something went wrong. They tried to let me die, but that failed too, so now I live in this container.</text>  
</string>

<string id="dead_stalker_start_dialog_1_phrase_3">
<text>Wow!</text>  
</string>

<string id="dead_stalker_start_dialog_1_phrase_4">
<text>...</text>  
</string>

<string id="dead_stalker_start_dialog_1_phrase_40">
<text>I can't but ask: what's it like? I mean, this existence.</text>  
</string>

<string id="dead_stalker_start_dialog_1_phrase_400">
<text>From what point of view to would you like me to evaluate. On the one hand, I feel no physical pain, I have no need for sleep or food. The experiment made me part of the Zone, giving me access to knowledge, which in itself can be considered a reward. In addition, I lost the majority of the threads connecting me with a habitual material world. My connection with the conventional body shell, is - nothing more than ... uh ... a "speaker", bringing my speech  to you in a clear verbal form. Its destruction is unable to cause the death of my mind, so you can consider me immortal..</text>  
</string>

<string id="dead_stalker_start_dialog_1_phrase_401">
<text>I wonder ... Is it possible to give me knowledge about the Zone in more detail?</text>  
</string>

<string id="dead_stalker_start_dialog_1_phrase_402">
<text>Every living thing, coming into the Zone, to some extent, becomes a part of it, and the longer a creature is in the Zone, the more in harmony  it comes with the Zone. As a result, it forms its very essence. Of course, the degree of mutual integration of its existing areas and their symbiosis and influence each other depends on many factors which together can be called a "personal preference", or vice versa, "immunity". Another determining factor is the length of interaction. Over time, the thoughts and messages of a being start getting into the Zone, and the being starts catching messages which in essence are the thoughts and messages of other beings in the Zone...\n\n All the above applies more to the creatures that came in the Zone - Zone mutants initially are more closely related to it.</text>  
</string>

<string id="dead_stalker_start_dialog_1_phrase_403">
<text>This is all very confusing...</text>  
</string>

<string id="dead_stalker_start_dialog_1_phrase_404">
<text>It's easier to feel than to explain. To facilitate understanding, here's an example: \n \n If a new danger appears in the Zone, for example, an anomaly. If the first dead victim is a blind dog, it will send an information envelope to the Zone containing details of pain and despair coupled with the preceding pain symptoms that characterize this anomaly - with specific smell, sounds and other feelings. Once the Zone obtains the information envelope, this information is made available to most of the inhabitants associated with it. Let's say, an experienced pseudo-dog, having faced this same anomaly for the first time, will be able to avoid it. \n\nThis introduction of collective wisdom allows organisms to survive among the many dangers. As stalkers share this information with others on one network, the inhabitants of the Zone, to a greater or lesser extent are united as one.\n\nThat's how I have become aware of some of the features and secrets of the Zone. Clear?</text>  
</string>

<string id="dead_stalker_start_dialog_1_phrase_405">
<text>More or less. Returning to your existence...</text>  
</string>

<string id="dead_stalker_start_dialog_1_phrase_406">
<text>That's one side of the coin. The other is this ... Let me ask you: What is your attitude to immortality?</text>  
</string>

<string id="dead_stalker_start_dialog_1_phrase_407">
<text>Hmm ... This is an ambiguous question that cannot be described in a few words.</text>  
</string>

<string id="dead_stalker_start_dialog_1_phrase_408">
<text>It's possible to dream of immortality, but it's also possible to be afraid of it... From it emanates an inevitable horror... In the course of affairs, I have a request of you. Interested? As a reward, I will share all of my knowledge with you.</text>  
</string>

<string id="dead_stalker_start_dialog_1_phrase_4080">
<text>And what is your request?</text>  
</string>

<string id="dead_stalker_start_dialog_1_phrase_40800">
<text>Actually, there are two parts. First, I ask you to find and bring me some anomalous formations or, what you call, artefacts. After that, they will have to make a series of manipulations, and bring me the obtained results. \n\n There are no time limits, so you need not fear that my request will distract you from the other cases.</text>  
</string>

<string id="dead_stalker_start_dialog_1_phrase_40801">
<text>I agree, perhaps. Tell me.</text>  
</string>

<string id="dead_stalker_start_dialog_1_phrase_408010">
<text>Thank you! So now you have to find three rare artefacts. Remember, better still, write down what I tell you - this will help you in your search. \n\n The first of these you may have already encountered: stalkers call it a 'cobblestone', because that's what it looks like - an unremarkable shapeless gray-brown formation. The artefact always appears only near large metal structures. The most striking telltale sign that the artefact has formed is the presence of a psi-area and strong distortion of radio signals within a radius of 250 metres from the artefact. Don't worry, the "cobblestone" isn't hazardous to health, apart from its radioactivity. \n\n Keep that in mind.</text>  
</string>

<string id="dead_stalker_start_dialog_1_phrase_408011">
<text>Litter currently. What's next?</text>  
</string>

<string id="dead_stalker_start_dialog_1_phrase_408012">
<text>The second artefact I need is called a "Firefly". I find all the details of its origin difficult to define, but I know enough: The "Firefly" appears only in the "Elektra" anomaly and only in the rain. If you don't remove the artefact from the anomaly, it will be destroyed once the rain stops. Don't worry, you won't have to go into every "Elektra" you encounter: In fact, the artefacts are continually being produced by the anomaly. It has a most significant distinguishing feature - its presence changes the colour of the anomaly to a pale green, to which the artefact owes its name. \n\n Is that clear?</text>  
</string>

<string id="dead_stalker_start_dialog_1_phrase_408013">
<text>The rain constantly triggers a colour change in the "Elektra" to pale green... What's the third artefact?</text>  
</string>

<string id="dead_stalker_start_dialog_1_phrase_408014">
<text>The third artefact is the most unusual - you will probably be the first person to discover it, so you can give it a name. Its peculiarity is that it's only visible during the phenomenon that you call an "emission". It is this abrupt increase in the anomalous energy that leads to its manifestation; the rest of the time it's invisible.</text>  
</string>

<string id="dead_stalker_start_dialog_1_phrase_408015">
<text>A chameleon right... Wait! Do I have to walk around the Zone during emissions?</text>  
</string>

<string id="dead_stalker_start_dialog_1_phrase_408016">
<text>No, of course not, this would lead to your death. If you are lucky, hopefully this "Chameleon", as you've called it, will appear not far from your shelter. Like I said before, there's no time-frame; or any other way to get the artefact.</text>  
</string>

<string id="dead_stalker_start_dialog_1_phrase_408017">
<text>Not a trivial matter... But I'll try to help.</text>  
</string>

<string id="dead_stalker_start_dialog_1_phrase_408018">
<text>I'm counting on you! As for the second part - we'll discuss it when you have collected all the artefacts.</text>  
</string>

<string id="dead_stalker_start_dialog_1_phrase_408019">
<text>Ha! To be continued...</text>  
</string>

<string id="dead_stalker_start_dialog_1_phrase_40802">
<text>No, I cannot yet.</text>  
</string>

<string id="dead_stalker_start_dialog_1_phrase_4081">
<text>Maybe next time.</text>  
</string>

<string id="dead_stalker_start_dialog_1_phrase_41">
<text>Well, I'll go...</text>  
</string>

<string id="dead_stalker_start_dialog_2_phrase_0">
<text>Hello again! Glad to see you. To what do I owe this visit?</text>  
</string>

<string id="dead_stalker_start_dialog_2_phrase_505">
<text>Thank you became like everything in its place!</text>  
</string>

<string id="dead_stalker_start_dialog_2_phrase_51">
<text>You have any requests?</text>  
</string>

<string id="dead_stalker_start_dialog_2_phrase_510">
<text>I want you to find three rare artefact. Remember, better still, write down what I tell you - this will help you in your search. \n\n The first of these you may have already encountered: stalkers call it a 'cobblestone', because that's what it looks like - an unremarkable shapeless grey-brown formation. The artefact always appears only near large metal structures. The most striking tell-tale sign that the artefact has formed is the presence of a psi-area and strong distortion of radio signals within a radius of 250 metres from the artefact. Don't worry, the "cobblestone" isn't hazardous to health, apart from its radioactivity. \n\n Keep that in mind.</text>  
</string>

<string id="dead_stalker_start_dialog_2_phrase_52">
<text>I think I found everything that you asked for.</text>  
</string>

<string id="dead_stalker_start_dialog_2_phrase_520">
<text>You have no idea, how glad I am to hear that!</text>  
</string>

<string id="dead_stalker_start_dialog_2_phrase_521">
<text>You're welcome.</text>  
</string>

<string id="dead_stalker_start_dialog_2_phrase_53">
<text>I assume there is a second part to the quest?</text>  
</string>

<string id="dead_stalker_start_dialog_2_phrase_530">
<text>Yes, but it's not a "part" of it, but only the last small touch. Your task - is to put all three artefacts into the "Fruit punch" anomaly which is on the first level of the laboratory, and bring back the resulting artefact to me. Just don't try to activate it, or carry it on your belt - it will lead to your instant death!</text>  
</string>

<string id="dead_stalker_start_dialog_2_phrase_531">
<text>Well, I'll be careful. See you soon!</text>  
</string>

<string id="dead_stalker_start_dialog_2_phrase_54">
<text>I've fulfilled your request. Here's what turned out.</text>  
</string>

<string id="dead_stalker_start_dialog_2_phrase_540">
<text>Thank you friend! Your help was invaluable to me! I can't thank you enough: here's a little something for you.</text>  
</string>

<string id="dead_stalker_start_dialog_2_phrase_541">
<text>And thank you. Can you tell me, why are you doing this?</text>  
</string>

<string id="dead_stalker_start_dialog_2_phrase_542">
<text>You remember, we agreed on the ambiguity of the question of immortality? So, immortality is a gift we are free to keep until we decide when to part with it. Otherwise it's a punishment akin to the agony of a paralysed person, not being able to put an end to their torment. Such was the other side of my existence. Now that I have the artefact, no one can stop me, I'll activate it - whenever I want.</text>  
</string>

<string id="dead_stalker_start_dialog_2_phrase_543">
<text>Hmm... Well, okay. Glad to be of help.</text>  
</string>

<string id="dead_stalker_start_dialog_2_phrase_55">
<text>Does it seem, the disorder in the lab has become worse?</text>  
</string>

<string id="dead_stalker_start_dialog_2_phrase_550">
<text>No, it doesn't. This baby is getting a little angry. And I really, really beg you to make him stop! I can no longer tolerate his presence! Help me! Please!</text>  
</string>

<string id="dead_stalker_start_dialog_2_phrase_551">
<text>You're mighty fed up... What 'baby'?</text>  
</string>

<string id="dead_stalker_start_dialog_2_phrase_552">
<text>Baby giant. After the death of its parent the baby huddled somewhere for a while, but then hunger drove him out of hiding. Now the trouble begins! The baby began to eat everything, from rats to the remainder of the laboratory equipment. You can't imagine the bedlam he's caused. Only the Zone knows how many artefacts he's swallowed that's caught his eye! Since then, he suffers, and does not give me a rest. He goes into hiding, then again hysteria begins... \n\n I beg you, please help me!</text>  
</string>

<string id="dead_stalker_start_dialog_2_phrase_553a">
<text>I'll help, why not. At the same time we can diversify the menu at the Bar...</text>  
</string>

<string id="dead_stalker_start_dialog_2_phrase_554a">
<text>Not likely. You see, the baby now - is a little tank. As you know, pseudo giants themselves are tough, and swallowing artefacts provide them with additional protection.</text>  
</string>

<string id="dead_stalker_start_dialog_2_phrase_553b">
<text>Not this time, sorry. I don't have much ammunition.</text>  
</string>

<string id="dead_stalker_start_dialog_2_phrase_554b">
<text>I won't waste the ammunition - because in this case, it would be useless. You see, the baby now - is a little tank. As you know, pseudo giants themselves are tough, and swallowing artefacts provide them with additional protection.</text>  
</string>

<string id="dead_stalker_start_dialog_2_phrase_555">
<text>Well, what do you suggest in this case?</text>  
</string>

<string id="dead_stalker_start_dialog_2_phrase_556">
<text>A handmade anomaly - that's what we need. Just bear in mind: you only get one shot - the baby won't fall into the same trap a second time, even if you lay out ten. The anomaly must be sufficiently powerful and tenacious to cope with it, something from the "major" group of artefacts. I think the "Goldfish" is ideal. \n\n What do you say? Will you help me?</text>  
</string>

<string id="dead_stalker_start_dialog_2_phrase_557">
<text>Ok, I'm sold. Where do I find your "baby"?</text>  
</string>

<string id="dead_stalker_start_dialog_2_phrase_5570">
<text>He roams on the second level of the laboratory, I don't think that you can miss him.</text>  
</string>

<string id="dead_stalker_start_dialog_2_phrase_5571">
<text>Yeah, I got it. I'll tell you later how it went.</text>  
</string>

<string id="dead_stalker_start_dialog_2_phrase_558">
<text>I'll help, but later. When I get hold of the necessary artefact.</text>  
</string>

<string id="dead_stalker_start_dialog_2_phrase_5580">
<text>Okay, I'll wait a bit then.</text>  
</string>

<string id="dead_stalker_start_dialog_2_phrase_56">
<text>How's your 'little giant' problem? Has he died yet?</text>  
</string>

<string id="dead_stalker_start_dialog_2_phrase_560">
<text>No, unfortunately. Will you help?</text>  
</string>

<string id="dead_stalker_start_dialog_2_phrase_57">
<text>I solved your "little" problem.</text>  
</string>

<string id="dead_stalker_start_dialog_2_phrase_570">

<text>Bandits! Those sons of bitches were taking me to the old factory. I don't know what they were planning to do with me. I saw them take another guy in there before and I never saw him again. They have another of ours, Sergei. They keep him in the basement of that big unfinished building. Help him, would you? Otherwise they'll... you know...</text>

<string id="val_escort_captive_dialog_2">
<text>Do you know what they have at the factory?</text>
</string>

<string id="val_escort_captive_dialog_21">
<text>I haven't heard much. All I know is that their boss Borov has one key to the underground there. There used to be a lab inside, or something. I did hear that Borov has been eager to get inside, but can't without the second key. Umm... if you're thinking of trying to get inside, think twice before you do. It's full of thugs.</text>

<text>Thank you brother! You freed my partner. Here, take this - in gratitude.</text>

<text>That's a bargain.</text>
</string>

<string id="val_escort_nap1_dialog_212">
<text>I guess you're familiar with this place. What's interesting here?</text>
</string>

<string id="val_escort_nap1_dialog_2121">
<text>To the North there's a bandit camp, To the East an old factory, to the South-west a deserted pig farm, and some kind of gate beyond that. I can't say what's there, never been that far.</text>
</string>

<string id="val_escort_nap1_dialog_21211">
<text>Can you tell me more about the bandit camp?</text>
</string>

<string id="val_escort_nap1_dialog_212111">
<text>More... They settled in an unfinished building just North of here.Their chief is Borov - a real beast, we are looking for him. We were sent here to kill him.</text>

<text>What's going on in the factory?</text>
</string>

<string id="val_escort_nap1_dialog_212121">
<text>We managed to find out that there is an entrance to some kind of vault there. There's only gangsters guarding it, that's good.</text>

<text>What kind of vault? What's inside it?</text>
</string>

<string id="val_escort_nap1_dialog_21212111">
<text>I don't know. We don't meddle there. I only know that Borov has one of the keys to its entrance.</text>
</string>

<string id="val_escort_nap1_dialog_21213">
<text>A real pig farm? With actual pigs?</text>
</string>

<string id="val_escort_nap1_dialog_212131">
<text>Salivating for some real pork chops, huh? Heck, the Zone is full of boars! Eat this - before you know it, you will glow in the dark, you won't need a flashlight anymore! Okay, just kidding, just kidding ... The farm has been abandoned for a long time, some stalkers have settled there now. They didn't make a good impression on me and I usually trust my gut feeling.</text>
</string>

<string id="val_escort_nap1_dialog_21214">
<text>What's this gate you were talking about?</text>
</string>

<string id="val_escort_nap1_dialog_212141">
<text>I can't figure it out. Just an old gate except it's locked and well guarded. We haven't set foot in there.</text>

<text>I see, thanks.</text>

<text>Just the two of you went on a scouting raid?</text>

<string id="val_escort_nap1_dialog_2131">
<text>There were two others. I don't know where they have gone, I've heard nothing... Maybe they were killed by the bandits.</text>

<string id="val_prisoner_hello_21">
<text>Thanks brother! I owe you one. Look what I found out - it may come in handy, you never know... Borov - he's their ringleader, in his store, he has a lot of goods. He has one of the keys to the dungeon in the old factory. My guards were gabbing that there used to be some kind of laboratory there. Only, getting to Borov won't be easy.</text>

<string id="val_prisoner_hello_211">
<text>Thanks for the information.</text>

<text>Okay, I'll take a look.</text>

<string id="val_rob_dialog_11">
<text>Hey, do you want a cool gun need? I found something near Yantar... it was hidden in a cache. Among the stuff, was a gauss gun. It's in excellent condition, I assure you - it will kill anything outright within a hundred metres. I'll sell it to you, if you're interested. It's only 800 roubles, it will take a few minutes for me to bring it.</text>

<string id="val_rob_dialog_111">
<text>Here's the money.</text>

<string id="val_rob_dialog_112">

<text>Thank you, my friend, you rescued me, no words can express my gratitude. If I live long enough to run into you again - I will repay my debt to you. But for now, I can share some interesting information with you. To the south of here is a farm, where free stalkers have settled. One of them is selling a gauss gun very cheaply, for only 800 roubles. I was on my way to buy it when you came along - but as you can see, I got into deep shit... So, if you have the money, get it.</text>
