		<text>Oh, another customer! Come here, don't be so shy!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="military_trader_about">
		<text>You, quiet here, sergeants are nervous. Keep your gun in your pants. We're not military anymore, we're on our own for last couple of months. Officially we're M.I.A. Serving in Institute is a suicide, man. When it became impossible I made a deal with sergeants and we "desappeared". But there's still a bond with friends, we trades artifacts for ammo, meds and other equipment. Just need some more money to leave Zone. However, when somebody alarmed Institute, we got a jackpot. Military in Institute received enormous amount of excellent equipment and now we sell it, inexpensively. So don't be shy, check it and we can make a deal.</text>

	<string id="military_trader_buy">
		<text>Well, show me your stuff.</text>

	<string id="bandit_trader_1">
		<text>I'm not him, I'm his brother. We have a deal with bandits: loot for equipment and food. Also I sell a junk that they bring to me. Got it? So what's your business? Are we trading or not?</text>
